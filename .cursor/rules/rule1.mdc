# Coding Standards

- Use functional and declarative patterns over object-oriented ones.
- Prefer modular, reusable code with minimal duplication.
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).
- Include robust error handling and validation.
- Break complex logic into helper functions.
