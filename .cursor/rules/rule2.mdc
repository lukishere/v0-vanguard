# Coding Standards

- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless required.
- Prefer modular, reusable code with minimal duplication.
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).
- Enforce robust error handling and validation.
- Validate inputs and preconditions early (guard clauses).
- Place happy-path logic last.
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
- Log or report unexpected errors.
- Always include unit tests for utility functions.
- Use semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA attributes where relevant.
- Reference existing patterns and files for context.
- Avoid deprecated patterns; use only approved, up-to-date practices.
